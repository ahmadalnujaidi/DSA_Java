an algorithm is a set of instructions  to perform a task or to solve a given problem.

for example: a recipe book is a collection of recipes in which each recipe provides a step by step instruction to prepare food.

lets say you want to prepare a tea. So, the steps would be:
    1. boil water
    2. put tea in tea pot
    3. add hot water
    4. put hot tea in tea cups
    5. do you need sugar?
        a. if yes, put it into tea cups
        b. if no, skip this step
    6. stir, drink and enjoy!


print average of 3 numbers.
lets say you want to write an algorithm for it. so the steps would be:
    1. perform sum of 3 numbers
    2. store it in a variable sum
    3. divide sum by 3
    4. store the value in a variable average
    5. print average

        public void findAvg(int a, int b, int c){
            int sum = a + b + c;
            int avg = sum / 3;
            System.out.println(avg);
        }
