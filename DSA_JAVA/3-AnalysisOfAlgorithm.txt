an algorithm is a set of instruction to perform a task or solve a given problem.

there are several different algorithms to solve a given problem

* analysis of algorithms deals in finding best algorithm which runs fast and takes least in memory.

for example:
    Q. find sum of first n natural numbers.
        a.  input: n = 4
            output: 10 i.e (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

        b.  input: n = 5
            output: 15 i.e (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)

first algorithm example:
    
    public int findSum(int n){
        return n * (n + 1) / 2
    }

second algorithm example:

    public int findSum(int n){
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            sum = sum + i;
        }
    return sum;
    }

to determine which is better we consider:
                                            1- time complexity
                                            2- space complexity
