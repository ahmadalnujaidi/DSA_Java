TIME COMPLEXITY

its the amount of time taken by the algorithm to run.
The input processed by an algorithm helps in determining the time complexity.


first algorithm example: This one will be more efficient, because less time taken compared to second algorithm
    
    public int findSum(int n){
        return n * (n + 1) / 2
    }

second algorithm example: This one will take more time.

    public int findSum(int n){
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            sum = sum + i;
        }
    return sum;
    }
