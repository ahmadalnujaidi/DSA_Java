HOW TO CREATE A SINGLY LINKED LIST IN JAVA:

a singly linked list is a datastructure that stores collection of data. it contains a sequence of nodes.

            simple singly linked list...

            head
             |
             V
            [10][] -> [1][] -> [8][] -> [11][] -> null

each node contains a data property, and a reference to the next node in the list


how to create:

            // head is instance variable
            head = new ListNode(10);
            ListNode second = new ListNode(1);
            ListNode third = new ListNode(8);
            ListNode fourth = new ListNode(11);
            head.next = second;
            second.next = third;
            third.next = fourth;

first step head -> null
moving ahead... we create new ListNode and pass 10 as data: head -> [10][] -> null
moving ahead... creating new list node: second -> [1][] -> null, next pointing to null
moving ahead... creating new list node: third -> [8][] -> null, next pointing to null
moving ahead... creating new list node: fourth -> [11][] -> null, next pointing to null
in order to create singly linked list, you connect all nodes together and form a chain
we assign the value of second, to head's next: head.next = second;
second.next = third;
third.next = fourth;

            head
             |
             V
            [10][] -> [1][] -> [8][] -> [11][] -> null

head is holding complete list together
