DELETE FIRST NODE OF A SINGLY LINKED LIST:

    head
     |
     V
     10[] -> 1[] -> 11[] -> null

                                                public ListNode deleteFirst(){
                                                    if(head == null){
                                                        return null;
                                                    }
                                                    ListNode temp = head;
                                                    head = head.next;
                                                    temo.next = null;
                                                    return temp;
                                                }
when we call deleteFirst();
    check if head == null, it means no nodes to delete, return null.
    our head points to 10:
        create temp node that points to first node.
                                                           head
                                                            |
                                                            V
                                                            10[] -> 1[] -> 11[] -> null
                                                            ^
                                                            |
                                                           temp
after deletion it should only have 2 nodes.
    we traverse the head to the second node by head = head.next;
                                                                   head
                                                                    |
                                                                    V
                                                            10[] -> 1[] -> 11[] -> null
                                                            ^
                                                            |
                                                           temp
then we can safely delete first node.
    we must break linkage, so set temp.next = null;... no more pointing from first node to head: temp -> 10[] -> null
    simply return temporary listNode as last step.
    only 2 nodes left with head starting at head -> 1[] -> 11[] -> null
