DELETE A NODE FROM A SINGLY LINKED LIST AT A GIVEN POSITION:

Q. implement method to delete a node at a given position. Assuming position to be valid and starting from 1.

    for example:
        head
         |
         V
        8[] -> 10[] -> 7[] -> 1[] -> null
                                                if (position == 1){
                                                    head = head.next;
                                                } else {
                                                    ListNode previous = head;
                                                    int count = 1;
                                                    while (count < position - 1){
                                                        previous = previous.next;
                                                        count++;
                                                    }
                                                    ListNode current = previous.next;
                                                    previous.next = current.next;
                                                }
delete(1)
    position = 1
        we simply assign head.next to head. so now head points to second node.

delete(3)
    position = 3
        if statement is false, we go to else.
        we must somehow reach position (2) so we create a ListNode "previous"
        traverse to (position - 1)
          head
            |
            V
            8[] -> 10[] -> 7[] -> 1[] -> null
                    ^
                    |
                 previous

now delete node at position 3
    we must break the link, but we need to connect to what comes after position 3
    make ListNode current, it will point to previous.next which is position 3 itself current -> 7[]
    we simply assign previous.next to current.next which skips of the "current" node which is 7[]
        
        head  previous current
         |      |       |
         V      V       V
        8[] -> 10[] -> 7[] -> 1[] -> null
                |              ^
                ---------------|         
it becomes:
            head
            |
            V
            8[] -> 10[] -> 1[] -> null
