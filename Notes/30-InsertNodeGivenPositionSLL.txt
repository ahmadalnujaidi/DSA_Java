INSERT A NODE IN A SINGLY LINKED LIST AT A GIVEN POSITION:

Q. implement method to insert a node at a given position. Assuming position to be valid and starting from 1.
    for example: given following singly linked list
    head
     |
     V 
    10[] -> 1[] -> 8[] -> 11[] -> null


lets see demo of algorithm step by step
    head
     |
     V 
    10[] -> 1[] -> null
                            ListNode node = new ListNode(data);
                            if(position ==1){
                                node.next = head;
                                head = node;
                            } else {
                                ListNode previous = null;
                                int count = 1;
                                while(count < position - 1){
                                    previous = previous.next;
                                    count++;
                                }
                                ListNode current = previous.next;
                                node.next = current;
                                previous.next = node;
                            }

insert(8, 1)
position = 1        
    node -> 8[]               head
              |                 |
              V                 V 
             null              10[] -> 1[] -> null

the if(position == 1) is true, so node's next will point to head: node -> 8[] -> 10[], then head will be assigned to node so it starts from 8:
                                                                                                            head -> 8[] -> 10[] -> 1[] -> null

insert(7, 3), position = 3
            head
             |
             V
             8[] -> 10[] -> 1[] -> null

first create node with data 7: node -> 7[] -> null
    position != 1 so we skip over if() and else part will be executed
    listNode previous = head, so we can start from head and traverse over the nodes until we reach position - 1, to break the link and make it point to new node then back
    when we reach to the position of node 10[] which is 2
    we create new ListNode current and assign the value of previous.next to it, ListNode current = previous.next which will hold the node 1[]
    then we make the node 7[]'s next point to current, node.next = current;
    then we break the link by assigning previous.next to node.

            head
             |
             V
             8[] -> 10[] WE BREAK IT HERE 1[] -> null
                       |                   ^
                       V                   |
              node -> 7[]-------------------

            
insert node at end:   
            head
             |
             V
             8[] -> 10[] -> null
insert(7, 3)
    it follows the exact same process.
