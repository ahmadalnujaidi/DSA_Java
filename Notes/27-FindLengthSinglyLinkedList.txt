HOW TO FIND THE LENGTH OF A SINGLY LINKED LIST:

            head
             |
             V
            [10][] -> [1][] -> [8][] -> [11][] -> null

        int count = 0;
        ListNode current = head;
        while(current!=null){
            count++;
            current = current.next;
        }
        return count;

initially count = 0 if current != null, it will count++;
count will end up being count = 4 and be returned...
