ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS OF AN ALGORITHM.

asymptotic analysis helps in evaluating the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size and its increase.
using asymptotic analysis we don't actually measure actual running time of algorithm
it gives us an idea of how the running time of an algorithm will behave as the input size increases
it helps in determining how time and space taken by an algorithm increases with input size
