HOW TO SEARCH AN ELEMENT IN A LINKED LIST IN JAVA:

        head
         |
         V
        10[] -> 8[] -> 1[] -> 11[] -> null

        ListNode current = head;
        while(current != null){
            if(current.data == searchKey){
                return true;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }
        return false;


searchKey = 1
we create current that points at head at beggining 
        head
         |
         V
        10[] -> 8[] -> 1[] -> 11[] -> null
        ^
        |
        current

traverse over the linked list and try to match searchKey to the current.data
