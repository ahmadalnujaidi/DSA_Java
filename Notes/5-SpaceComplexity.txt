SPACE COMPLEXITY

its the amount of memory or space taken by an algorithm to run.

The memory requrired to process the input by an algorithm helps in determining the space complexity...


            first algorithm example: 
                
                public int findSum(int n){
                    return n * (n + 1) / 2
                }



            second algorithm example:

                public int findSum(int n){
                    int sum = 0;
                    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
                        sum = sum + i;
                    }
                return sum;
                }
