DELETE LAST NODE OF A SINGLY LINKED LIST:
    head
     |
     V
     10[] -> 1[] -> 11[] -> null
                                    public ListNode deleteLast(){
                                        if (head == null || head.next == null){
                                            return head;
                                        }
                                        ListNode current = head;
                                        ListNode previous = null;
                                        while (current.next != null){
                                            previous = current;
                                            current = current.next;
                                        }
                                        previous.next = null;
                                        return current;
                                    }
we create 2 pointers
    "current" that treverses to last node
    the other "previous" which travels to the second last node

we call deleteLast()
    if statement is false, so skip.
    now we create 2 pointers, current & previous. current points at head, and previous points at null.
                            head
                            |
                            V
                            10[] -> 1[] -> 11[] -> null
                            ^
                            |
                            current
                            previous -> null
now current will traverse untill its current.next != null, which means the final node that points to null
in the first step we assign previous to current's position before it moves ahead.
    previous remains 1 step behind always

                           head   previous
                            |       |
                            V       V
                            10[] -> 1[] -> 11[] -> null
                                            ^
                                            |
                                          current
we terminate while loop since its false
    we assign a null value to previous.next
    it will break the linkage.
finally return the current.
