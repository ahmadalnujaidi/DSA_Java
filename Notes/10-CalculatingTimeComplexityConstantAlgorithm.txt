Calculating the Time Complexity of a Constant Algorithm:

    public int sum(int x, int y){
        int result = x + y;
        return result;
    }

    line no.    |    operations     |   unit time  
    2           |   1+1+1+1         |   4
    3           |   1+1             |   2


-we are accessing x thats 1 operation, then we are accessing y thats 2nd operating, then we are adding them thats a 3rd operation
then we are assigning it to result thats the 4th operation...

-we are accessing result thats 1st operation, then we are returning result thats the 2nd operation...

Total time taken: T = 4 + 2 = 6
        T = C (constant)

                    Time Complexity = O(1)
    
    public int get(int[] arr, int i){
        return arr[i];
    }

        constant algorithm...
