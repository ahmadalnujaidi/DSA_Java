ARRAY:

1. its a collection (box)..
2. it can hold many things (items)..
3. adjacent or contiguous
4. size of box is fixed and cannot be modified
5. being adjacent each is indexed and can be determined by its position


        array of 4 elements
arr[] -> [5, 9, 3, 10]
          0  1  2  3

          1. its a collection (box) of data elements of specified type
          2. all data holding ata have contiguous memory locations
          3. each element has two neighbors except first and last one
          4. size of array is fixed and cannot be modified once it is created
          5. being adjacent each element is indexed and can be determined by its position
          6. index starts at 0 and for (one dimensional array) it ends at length - 1
