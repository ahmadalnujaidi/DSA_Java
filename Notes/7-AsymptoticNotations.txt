ASYMPTOTIC NOTATIONS:

asymptotic notations are the mathmatical tools used to describe the running time of an algorithm in terms of input size.

Example: Performance of car in 1 litre of patrol...

Highway (min traffic) - 25km/litre
City (max traffic) - 15km/litre
City + Highway (avg traffic) - 20km/litre

asymptotic notations help us in determining:
1. Best Case
2. Average Case
3. Worst Case
