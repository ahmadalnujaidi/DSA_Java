HOW TO INSERT NODE AT THE END OF A SINGLY LINKED LIST:


                                    ListNode newNode = ListNode(value);
                                    if(head == null){
                                        head = newNode;
                                        return;
                                    }
                                    ListNode current = head;
                                    while(null != current.next){
                                        current = current.next;
                                    }
                                    current.next = newNode;

if singly linked list empty:
    head -> null
value = 11
    we create a new ListNode by passing value into constructor...
        head    newNode
         |         |
         V         V
        null       11 -> null 

since head == null, we'll just appoint head = newNode: head -> 11 -> null;

value = 8
    create new listNode passing 8 into constructor
    head -> 11 -> null      newNode -> 8 -> null
        we assign current to head so..
          head                 newNode
           |                      |
           V                      V
current -> 11 -> null             8 -> null 

    we iterate in the while loop until current.next is null, knowing its the last node of the linked list
        once it beocomes null we assign current.next to the newNode. So...

        head -> 11 -> 8 -> null
